# Task 0005: Implement Frontend Project UI

## Context
**Related SRD**: `srd-main.md` (section 2)
**Related PRD User Story**: Project Management - Main UI, Project Tile UI, Edit Project Name, Delete Project
**System**: Vibe Coding Accelerator
**Component**: Angular Frontend

## Objective
Build the main UI for project management, including tile view, search, sort, create, rename, and delete actions, with modal confirmations and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Main UI displays all non-deleted projects as tiles
- [x] Projects are sortable and searchable
- [x] User can create, rename, and delete projects via UI
- [x] All actions use modals for confirmation/errors
- [x] UI updates immediately on changes
- [x] Unit/integration tests for UI logic

## Technical Requirements
### Implementation Details
- Use Angular components/services for project management
- Implement modals for create, rename, delete
- Use Angular Material or similar for UI components
- Connect to backend APIs for all actions
- Desktop-optimized layout

### File Changes Expected
- `src/app/components/project-list/` - Tile view component
- `src/app/components/project-modal/` - Modal dialogs
- `src/app/services/project.service.ts` - API integration
- `tests/unit/project-list.component.spec.ts` - Unit tests

### Database Changes (if applicable)
- None

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Unit tests for services and components
- [x] Integration tests for API communication
- [x] Manual testing verified (frontend and backend communication)

## Dependencies
**Prerequisite Tasks**: 
- [x] Task 0002: Initialize Angular Frontend
- [x] Task 0004: Implement Project CRUD APIs

**Blocking Tasks** (tasks that depend on this one):
- Task 0006+: File upload and management UI integration

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented according to acceptance criteria
- [x] All tests passing (unit and integration)
- [x] Code reviewed (if team workflow requires)
- [x] Documentation updated (inline comments, README changes)
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

## Implementation Summary (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All acceptance criteria validated and implemented

**Files Implemented**:
- ✅ `src/app/services/project.service.ts` - Angular service for project API integration
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-list/project-list.component.ts` - Main project tile view component
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-list/project-list.component.html` - Project list template with search/sort
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-list/project-list.component.scss` - Responsive project tile styling
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-modal/project-modal.component.ts` - Modal component for create/rename/delete
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-modal/project-modal.component.html` - Modal templates for all actions
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-modal/project-modal.component.scss` - Modal styling and animations
- ✅ `src/app/components/main-ui/main-ui.component.ts` - Updated to include project list
- ✅ `src/app/components/main-ui/main-ui.component.html` - Simplified main UI layout
- ✅ `src/app/app.config.ts` - Added HttpClient provider for API communication
- ✅ `src/app/services/project.service.spec.ts` - Comprehensive service tests
- ✅ `src/app/components/project-list/project-list.component.spec.ts` - Component unit tests

**Functionality Validated**:
- ✅ **Project Tiles**: Grid layout displaying all non-deleted projects with icons and metadata
- ✅ **Search**: Real-time filtering by project name or display name
- ✅ **Sort**: Toggle between most recent and alphabetical sorting
- ✅ **Create Project**: Modal dialog with name validation and duplicate prevention
- ✅ **Rename Project**: Modal dialog with current name pre-filled and collision checking
- ✅ **Delete Project**: Confirmation modal with warning about soft delete behavior
- ✅ **Navigation**: Click project tiles to navigate to project view (/project/:name)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages in modals and error banners
- ✅ **Loading States**: Spinner animations and disabled buttons during operations
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Desktop-optimized layout with mobile adaptability

**Technical Implementation**:
- Angular 20+ standalone components with proper TypeScript typing
- HttpClient integration with full error handling and loading states
- Custom modal system with event-based communication
- Comprehensive CSS with animations and hover effects
- Real-time search and sorting with immediate UI updates
- Project service with observable-based API communication
- Complete test coverage for services and components
- Production-ready build with minimal bundle size warnings

**API Integration**:
- GET /api/projects - Load and display all projects
- POST /api/projects - Create new projects with validation
- PUT /api/projects/:name - Rename projects with collision prevention  
- DELETE /api/projects/:name - Soft delete projects with confirmation
- Full error handling for 400/404/409/500 status codes
- Immediate UI updates after successful operations
