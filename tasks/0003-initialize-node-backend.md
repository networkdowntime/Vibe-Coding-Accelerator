# Task 0003: Initialize Node.js Backend

## Context
**Related SRD**: `srd-main.md` (section 2, 3)
**Related PRD User Story**: Project Management - Project CRUD, File Management
**System**: Vibe Coding Accelerator
**Component**: Node.js Backend

## Objective
Set up the Node.js backend with Express (or similar), initial API endpoints, and local file operations support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Node.js backend is initialized in `src/`
- [x] Express server runs locally
- [x] API endpoints for project CRUD and file management are scaffolded
- [x] Backend can read/write to local filesystem (projects, ai_agents)
- [x] API is accessible from Angular frontend

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary
- Node.js 18+ backend with Express.js successfully initialized in `src/backend/`
- Express server running on port 3001 with CORS enabled for frontend access
- Complete project CRUD API endpoints implemented and tested:
  - GET /api/projects - List all projects
  - POST /api/projects - Create new project
  - PUT /api/projects/:projectName - Rename project
  - DELETE /api/projects/:projectName - Delete project (soft delete)
- Complete file management API endpoints implemented and tested:
  - GET /api/projects/:projectName/files - List project files
  - POST /api/projects/:projectName/files - Upload file
  - GET /api/projects/:projectName/files/:fileName - Get file content
  - PUT /api/projects/:projectName/files/:fileName - Rename file
  - DELETE /api/projects/:projectName/files/:fileName - Delete file
- Local filesystem operations working for both projects and files
- Supported file types: .txt, .md, .yml, .yaml, .html, .pdf
- Comprehensive test suite with 13 passing tests covering all functionality
- Error handling and validation implemented throughout
- Zero linting errors - production ready

## Technical Requirements
### Implementation Details
- Use Node.js 18+, Express.js
- Scaffold endpoints for project CRUD, file upload, file listing
- Implement local file operations (no DB)
- Enable CORS for frontend

### File Changes Expected
- `src/backend/` - Node.js backend scaffold
- `src/backend/routes/` - API routes
- `src/backend/controllers/` - Controllers

### Database Changes (if applicable)
- None
