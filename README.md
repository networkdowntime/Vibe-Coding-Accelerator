# Vibe Coding Accelerator

A comprehensive web-based platform that accelerates software development through AI-powered assistance, document management, and project organization tools.

## 🚀 Overview

The Vibe Coding Accelerator is designed to streamline the software development lifecycle by providing:

- **AI-Powered Code Assistance**: Integration with multiple LLM providers for intelligent code generation and review
- **Document Management**: Centralized management of project documentation, requirements, and technical specifications
- **Project Organization**: Structured project templates and scaffolding tools
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated consistency checks and traceability reporting
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based system for custom AI agents and workflows

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a modern, cloud-native architecture:

- **Frontend**: Angular 18+ with TypeScript for a responsive, accessible user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify for scalable API services
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage and project data
- **AI Integration**: Modular LLM processing with support for multiple providers
- **File Management**: Secure file upload and processing with virus scanning
